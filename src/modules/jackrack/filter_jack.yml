description: Process audio using JACK.
notes: >
  This can be used to receive audio from JACK by connecting only input ports.
  It can be used to output audio to JACK by connecting only the output ports.
  Or, you can use it as a filter with something like JACK Rack by connecting
  both output and input ports to send and receive.
  You can configure as many channels as you need and repeat the in_1/out_1
  pattern for as many channels as you have configured.
  If you are using a MLT consumer that uses ALSA, then you should start
  jackd with the dummy driver, e.g.: jackd -ddummy -r48000 -p2048.

bugs:
  - >
    MLT cannot automatically adapt to the sample rate at which JACK is configured.
    Please make sure they are configured the same.
  - Does not automatically reconfigure to the number of channels requested by consumer.
  - Some effects have a temporal side-effect that may not work well.
