  This filter works in conjunction with the mask_apply filter to make filter
  masking easier. This filter makes a snapshop of the frame before applying
  a filter, typically one to affect the alpha channel defining the mask. Then,
  the mask_apply filter uses a transition to composite the current frame's
  image over the snapshot. The typical use case is to add filters in the
  following sequence: mask_start, zero or more filters, mask_apply.
