  This producer has two roles:
  
  1. it handles the mappings of all file names to the other producers;
  
  2. it attaches normalizing filters (rescale, resize and resample) to the
  producers (when necessary).
  
  This producer simplifies many aspects of use. Essentially, it ensures that a 
  consumer will receive images and audio precisely as they request them.
